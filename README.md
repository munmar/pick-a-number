# Casino War (non card edition)
### How to Play:
1. Once the game has been initiated, the house and player are generated a number between 1-10. 
2. If the **player's** number is higher than the house's, then the **player** wins.
3. If the **house's** number is higher than the player's, then the **house** wins.
4. If the scores are a draw, then the game should continue until a winner is decided by sudden death.

P.s. I know these are not the full rules to proper Casino War. The game is unfinished and for this reason the rules above stand.
